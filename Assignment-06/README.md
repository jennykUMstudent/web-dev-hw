One form I come across is logging into a site. I also come across a form on shopping sites to put in my email for a discount, and a form on Dominoes.com to rate my online order process and leave comments. They mainly serve and a way to either sign me up for an automatic email list for offers, logging into websites, or to inform a company about my experience with online ordering.

I chose Bernices Bakery as my favorite brick-and-mortar establishment. I first decided to do the form since I wanted to do a table in Assignment-05. For the form I chose to do 4 options to pick, to it would theoretically be organized by what questions or comments a person has and how urgent it is to respond to the person. I then added general information with a comments section. Next, I went with putting the address at the bottom since that is the most common location for the address. Lastly, I made a table with the hours, phone number, and email address. The email was not shown on their main website, but I was able to find it on their facebook page.
