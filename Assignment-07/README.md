Free Response: I really liked this assignment module since the website doesn't look nearly as plain as the one's made in the past modules. After setting up document and meta elements, I set up the 5 div sections and chose heading names. I then found my songs video, album cover, song on Soundcloud, and the lyrics. Before adding the song information in I added the copyright info in first, since I thought the other info would be more complicated to add. I put the physical address of UM along with my email, since I felt it fit better than just a map. Then I added the song information into each of the divs, this was a lot more simple than I expected. I then decided to bold and underline the headings, I felt it made each section look a tad better.
