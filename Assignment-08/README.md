My experience with html was really interesting. All of the material was new to me. I thought it was generally easy to learn but very time consuming.


I am excited to learn it all! I have never worked with html before this class, and I can say the same for CSS. I think it will be a fun experience

For this assignment I made a logo to put at the top of the page. I then made an origami flamingo and took pictures for each of the steps. I then created the outline for the document. I made all of the pages with a title, and put a menu at the top and bottom of each of the pages. From there I found colors to put as the background. I next ordered my steps. I could not figure out how to easily work with the text size. I also couldn't get the text to be in the center of my list. I used the table on the contacts page since you only need one piece of paper for the origami. I used the comments and filling in the name and email/phone for my input elements along with a submit button.
