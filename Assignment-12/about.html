        <p>Welcome to Costa Alegre Day Spay <br>
        Our staff of 45 went through an intensive training program to bring you the best care possible. <br>
        We have mud and salt water pools with a capacity of 15, and 10 salt water float tanks. <br>
        <hr>Costa Alegre is a place to forget about the outside world.
        Because of this we ask phones to be silenced and customers to be curtious of one another.
        <br>We do have designated private and lounging spaces designated for phone usage.
        <br><hr> Our day spa is ADA accessable, any accomadations needed will not be a problem. <br>
        If you have service animals, they are welcome! However, we ask they be calm and collected and use the designated grass areas on the facility.</p>
