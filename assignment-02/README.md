# Assignment 2
## Jenny Keller
I decided to take creative coding to get gain an understanding of how to build a website. I think it's a useful skill when going into media arts as a career path. Being able to work on websites for companies, or develop my own website as my portfolio. I don't have a background in coding at all, so I also thought it would be a good class to get my first foundation.
I have learned 1) the internet vs the web, and how they work; 2) what a VCS is; and 3) what a cookie is
