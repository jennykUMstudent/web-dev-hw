Describe the difference between the
Universal: Selects every element on the page.
Element: Select specific types of elements.
Class: Selects every element in specific group.
Id: Selects an individual element.
Selecting an id over a class would be useful when you want to change something such as a text box under a photo. Elements would be better over a class when you want to change text color on headings.

Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.
I chose a brown-ish #562704 color for the heading text, along with orange #ff6c00 color text in the text boxes with a green #73AD21 color boarder. The background images stands out as the 70's to me, with bright earthy tones. When I see a shirt or bag with a "70's" design, that color pallet is usually the one I see most.

I first followed the steps, making the index document and then played around with different css elements.
I then found an images that stood out to me and it reminded me of the 70's and made it my background, instead of just a solid color. From here I made the heading and changed the font color. I added a square image and played with the boarder radius, making it more of an oval. Next I found a car and a movie from the 70's. I put a description text box underneath the photos with the transparency at .85%, and I adjusted the size on the text boxes. On the movie photo I put the position as relative to be directly below the photo.
